title: Library Reference 2.0

The SDK Library Reference has been redone in stellar style.

Some feedback I've gotten is that the current library reference leaves a lot to
be desired. In fact, I went to go look up a command myself and couldn't find the answer
I was looking for, and I had written the page!

Well, that's no good, and who can allow it to stay that way?

So I went back and added a lot more information to it, and built a custom layout for the
reference site.

It now includes:

- An overview of each library, including contents and basic usage.
- Syntax, parameters, return values, and descriptions for individual functions and constants.
- A nice landing page and collapsing sidebar to make finding what you need easier.
