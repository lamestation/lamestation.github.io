title: First Draft of Snake Tutorial
author: Brett Weir
---

Boy, howdy! I just finished a rough draft of the first complete game tutorial for LameStation: **Snake**!

You remember, right? Back when everyone had brick phones, and the only game that came installed on them was Snake? Yeah, *that* snake!

Well, if you've got yourself a LameStation and an afternoon to kill, might I suggest trying to make this game yourself? When you do, let me know what you think.

- What do you like?
- What do you not like?
- What do you not understand?
- How can I improve it?

I need all the feedback I can get!
