title: Why the Propeller?
author: Brett Weir

I don't think I've made it any secret that the [Propeller](https://www.parallax.com/product/p8x32a-d40) microcontroller from [Parallax](https://www.parallax.com/) is my favorite microcontroller. Why else would I base my entire LameStation ecosystem around it?

I am often asked at trade shows and events why I chose it, and not the Arduino or Raspberry Pi. So I'd like to take some time out to explain what it's all about.

## Reason 1. The Propeller Just Works

The Arduino is fine and good when you have a board that you need to turn on. It's a different story when you want to design your own product. Now you're in for fun.
