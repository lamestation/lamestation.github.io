# Windows Installation

PropellerIDE is packaged as a Windows installer that will guide the user throughout the installation process.

You will also need to [download the FTDI drivers](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/CDM/CDM21218_Setup.zip)
in order to connect LameStation to your computer.

# OS X Installation

PropellerIDE is packaged as a regular DMG image, so mount the Volume and drag the icon into the Applications folder.

You will also need to [download the FTDI drivers](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP/MacOSX/FTDIUSBSerialDriver_v2_2_18.dmg)
in order to connect LameStation to your computer.

# Ubuntu / Debian Installation

PropellerIDE requires a minimum of Qt 5.2 which is only available on Ubuntu as of 14.04.

After downloading the Debian package for your platform, install it with `dpkg`.

    $ sudo dpkg -i propelleride-(version)-amd64.deb

It will complain about dependencies at which point you can run `apt-get` to fix them.

    $ sudo apt-get install -f

Make sure you install the FTDI drivers!

    $ sudo apt-get install libftdi1

Add yourself to the `dialout` group so you can use the serial port, then reboot.

    $ sudo usermod -a -G dialout USER_NAME
    $ reboot
