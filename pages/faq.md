## Why is it called LameStation?

*Because it’s the best that 1989 had to offer!*

No, it’s because I discovered a DIY game console in school called the XGameStation, but since I had to do a hardware project, I decided to design my own. Because I wasn’t good at soldering, I made it easy to assemble. Because I needed to finish, I made it simple, not complicated. Because I wanted to learn, I wrote drivers that I could understand. And that’s what LameStation is today. A simple, finite platform designed for education. Essentially, a Lame version of the XGameStation!

## Where are you located? Do you have an office?

We are located in Lake Forest, CA (South Orange County), but we do not currently have an office that is open to the public. We are happy to arrange meetings if needed, however.

## Do you offer workshops/classes?

We currently do not offer any workshops or classes ourselves. We develop educational materials and assist schools in integrating it into their curriculum.

## Is this like an Arduino?

It's similar in that they are both microcontroller platforms, but they are wildly different under the hood.

Arduino uses Atmel AVR and ARM microcontrollers, which are traditional single-core architectures that use interrupts for multitasking.

In this way, the Propeller behaves more like a mini-FPGA, which allows you to endlessly reconfigure the architecture for your needs.

## Is this like a Raspberry Pi?

Nope. Raspberry Pi runs a full-featured operating system on a single-board computer. There are many, many layers of complexity between the user and the hardware on a Raspberry Pi.

LameStation is a simple microcontroller platform, and you program the hardware directly, byte for byte. This means you have total visibility into all software running on the system. That's not possible with a Raspberry Pi.

## What's the programming language?

The LameStation is programmed in Spin, which is a Python-like language designed specifically for the Propeller microcontroller, allowing

## What are the specs of the LameStation?

The LameStation runs a Parallax Propeller microcontroller, with 32kB program space, and 8 cores all running at 80 MHz.

## What’s the screen resolution?

128 x 64 pixels. For comparison, the original gameboy was 160 x 120 pixels.

## Have you thought about adding an SD card / color screen / home entertainment center?

Yes. Adding an SD card makes everything more complicated, and makes understanding more difficult. We could always add more to the LameStation, but that defeats the purpose of the kit.

## Does it come with games?

No, not technically. The SDK (software development kit) is available online at our website. You can download the information there.

## Can you only have one game at a time?

Yes, the console can only hold one game in memory at a time. However, you can load different games on it as you code/program them on your computer.

## Colored screen? I can’t see what’s on the screen, can you fix that?

At this time this is the screen we will be using, no color. It is a possible option to upgrade in the future. If students/clients are having trouble viewing items/games on the screen the contrast can be adjusted with the wheel located on the top left side. This wheel is labeled contrast.

## Do you sell the shirts?

T-shirts will be available for purchase on our website in the near future.
